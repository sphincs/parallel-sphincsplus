 * the memory will retain its contents after another allocation (possibly
 * done by someone outside this module).  So, to avoid this potential security
 * issue, we scrub the memory (at least, the parts that have data that would
 * make it possible to forge if it leaked) before releasing it.
 *
 * We use this, rather than having routines simply call memset, to avoid
 * potential problems with overenthusiastic optimizers.  Generally, we zeroize
 * an area immediately before it goes out of scope or we free it, however an
 * optimizer might conclude "they're about to release the memory, there's no
 * need to write to it first"
