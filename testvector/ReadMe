This directory doesn't contain any sources for the parallel Sphincs
implementation.  Instead, contains the logic we add to the Sphincs+ reference
code to generate the test vectors (testvector.h); these test vectors are
meant to verify that the parallel Sphincs code does the exact same operations
as the reference code.

These files are:
- testvector.py		This is the python script that actually generates the
			testvector.h.  It lives in the top level directory of
			the reference code
- Makefile		This includes the changes needed to generate the
			executable the python script needs.  It lives in the
			ref directory
- testvector.c		This is the source of the executable that actually
			generates the code.  It lives in the ref/test directory

To generate the test vectors, copy testvector.py and testvector.c to the
indicated directory; also modify the existing ref/Makefile to include the
changes in the above Makefile.

Then, running "./testvector.py" should generate the testvector.h file (in the
top level directory).
